# POP - APOP

### Prerequires:

- [MD5Hashing](https://md5hashing.net/)

-----------------

- For this challenge we will just do a quick cmd `strings ch23.pcapng` and we scroll up, we will able to see this hash: `QNAPOP bsmith 4ddd4137b84ff2db7291b568289717f0`

- We past the hash into MD5Hashing (make sure to put the MD5 as `Type Hash`)

- And we got this result: `<1755.1.5f403625.BcWGgpKzUPRC8vscWn0wuA==@vps-7e2f5a72>XXXXXXXXXXXX` (The XXXXX is the flag, so make it by yourself it's easy)
