# Look at it

### Prerequires:

- Nothing

-----------------

- This challenge was full guessing, so at the begin we see this: D7B9{9B7D_D7B9_DD77BB99}

- As we know every flag begin with FLAG so; "D7B9" -> FLAG

FLAG{9B7D_FLAG_DD77BB99}

- So for solve this challenge, just use this cipher:

```
D - F
7 - L
B - A
9 - G
```

- And you will have the flag
