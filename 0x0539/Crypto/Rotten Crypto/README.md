# Rotten Crypto

### Prerequires:

- [ROT13Decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher)

-----------------

- With the title, we can easily guess this is chall are based on ROT13.

- So if we use a classic site like rot13.com, it will not work, so I tried [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher)

- I put my ciphered text and I decrypt it, after this, I press CTRL+F and type FLAG.

- And we are able to see the flag (You have to convert the uppercase to the lowercase)
